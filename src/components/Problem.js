    <p>
        As mentioned before, React really forced me to stay organized, and doing so was quite tedious since one minor mistake can be difficult to trace with 
        the amount of files under my react folder. Since we have to import almost everything into the App.js, it took some time in understanding the pattern of what and 
        why we needed to import certain things. There was only much difficulty in installing react since I realized that, for NPM start to work we have to be in the same directory
        of our package.json file. Understanding how to import certain functionalities of React and organizing it properly took some time to learn aswell. I initially did all my functionalities in the App.js but 
        that ruins the whole idea of staying organized in React. Overall, it was great concept in implementing various functionalities with ease without having to look at a single
        file that had a chunk of HTML or CSS
