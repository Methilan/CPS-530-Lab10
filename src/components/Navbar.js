       1. First, Since I am a MAC user, I had to go and install NODEJS through their site <br/> <br/>

       2. In my terminal, I had to do the FOLLOWING: <br/>

          a. node - v : To check the version of NODEJS <br/> 
          b. brew install node <br/> 
          c. npx create-react-app fileName <br/> <br/> 

       3. Now, React will provide you with all the components necessary tools <br/> 

       4. To actually run the site, I first edited the provided App.js to input a simple HELLO WORLD <br/> 

       5. NPM START allows the local host of the web page <br/>
